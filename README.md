# KUBEDB

Kubernetes Controller that sets up databases, credentials and permissions in Doodle databases.

Build with [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).

Work in progress.

Name "kubedb" clashes with an open-source project: https://github.com/kubedb
We're going to have naming "clashes" (not technical, but on human level) if we ever decide to use that one.
